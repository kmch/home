CCD image from the optical time-projection chamber (OTPC) showing the horizontal component is presented on the left, while the corresponding photomultiplier waveform  (vertical component) is shown on the right as a yellow histogram together with the best-fitted SRIM simulation represented by the solid (red) line. The angle Î¸ of
the deuteron emission with respect to the horizontal plane is indicated.
