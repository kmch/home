For my BSc in nuclear physics, I helped analyse experimental data from REX-ISOLDE facility at CERN. We investigated a rare ùõΩ-decay channel of the exotic 6He isotope into the ùõº+ùëë continuum. Studying this decay channel allows us to better constrain the peculiar neutron halo of the 6He nucleus.

The above graphic from our [paper](https://journals.aps.org/prc/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevC.92.014316) presents a CCD image from the optical time-projection chamber (OTPC) [^1].


[^1]: The horizontal component is presented on the left, while the corresponding photomultiplier waveform  (vertical component) is shown on the right as a yellow histogram together with the best-fitted SRIM simulation represented by the solid (red) line. The angle Œ∏ of the deuteron emission with respect to the horizontal plane is indicated.
