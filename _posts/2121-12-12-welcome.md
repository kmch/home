Hi! I'm Kajetan, a physicist trying to understand how our home planet
was formed and how it operates. I'd love to know how to protect this unique paradise for as long as possible. 

I am an expert in high‑resolution, **3D wave imaging** techniques applicable to a variety of academic, industrial, and medical problems. 
My scientific attention has so far been focused on Earth’s interior, wave mechanics, **inverse problems** and object‑oriented design.    
I firmly believe in **reproducible research** and open‑source software. 

In 2022 I received a **PhD** in Earth Science from **Imperial College London**, at the time the **8th best university in the world**.  
Before that, I obtained three different degrees (BSc in physics, BSc in geology and MSc in geophysics) from the College of Inter-Faculty Individual Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences at the University of Warsaw. It was a fantastic adventure!

With this website, I aim to attract young people to **honest, curiosity-driven science**. I hope to get across
the fascination for the complexity of the 'physical' (natural) world that drew me to science in the first place.
Please drop me an [email](mailto:k.chrapkiewicz17@imperial.ac.uk) if you are interested in 
**collaboration, internship, advice, or just have a science-related question**. I am always happy to try and help!


I am **open for work** on environmentally and socially sustainable projects.
