We used a high-resolution technology based on inverting full seismic waveforms to image a small, high-melt-fraction magma chamber that was not detected with standard seismic tomography. The melt reservoir extends from ∼2 to at least 4 km below sea level (b.s.l.) at Kolumbo - a submarine volcano near Santorini, Greece. The chamber coincides with the termination point of the recent earthquake swarms and may be a missing link between a deeper melt reservoir and the high-temperature hydrothermal system venting at the crater floor. 


Below is the automatic English translation of the interview I gave to Bartłomiej Krawczyk

### Where is the submarine volcano Kolumbo located, and what are its characteristics?

Kolumbo is located about 7 kilometers northeast of Santorini, a highly popular tourist island in the Greek Cyclades archipelago. Santorini is not just one island but five subareal fragments of a massive caldera more than 10 km in diameter, which I probably don't need to introduce to the readers of the blog. Kolumbo's crater is several times smaller, with its highest point about 20 meters below the sea surface and its bottom about 500 meters below the surface.

Geologically, Kolumbo, along with Santorini and several other volcanoes, forms the so-called Hellenic volcanic arc, which has resulted from the ongoing collision of Africa and Eurasia over millions of years. It's worth mentioning that volcanic arcs are probably the most important of several genetic types of volcanoes, not only because of their explosiveness but primarily due to their fundamental role in the process of creating new continental crust. Not everyone knows that the formation of such volcanoes wouldn't be possible without enormous amounts of water saturating subducting tectonic plates plunging into the curved subduction zones. It is the water released at great depths from hydrated minerals composing the subducting plate that causes the Earth's mantle to melt and give birth to magmatic systems, with volcanic arcs being their surface expression. Contrary to appearances, the temperature of the mantle alone is not sufficient at this depth to cause melting, neither the mantle nor the rapidly subducting cold slab.

Returning to Kolumbo and Santorini, despite their proximity, these two volcanoes exhibit extremely different behaviors. Historically, Santorini has erupted much more frequently, while Kolumbo is currently the center of hydrothermal and seismic activity. In 2006, a large field of polymetallic hydrothermal chimneys emitting gases above 200 degrees Celsius was discovered on the bottom of Kolumbo's crater. The seismic activity indicates that relatively weak earthquakes are almost constantly occurring, generating magma and hydrothermal fluids that push through the rigid crust, migrating towards the surface.

### What is the history of its eruptions, and what are the hazards associated with the potential awakening of this submarine volcano?

We know little about the history of Kolumbo's eruptions, but it appears that there have been only a few, with an average frequency of one eruption every 200,000 years. The last eruption in 1615 AD caused significant devastation due to the resulting tsunami. Today, we would classify the magnitude of that eruption as VEI 4-5. For comparison, last year's Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai eruption had a magnitude of VEI 5-6, and the famous Krakatau eruption in 1883 was VEI 6.

Of course, the current hazards are greater than they were 400 years ago. Firstly, neighboring Santorini is besieged by tourists for most of the year. An ash plume and pumice rafts could disrupt air and sea transportation. What is less often discussed is the carbon dioxide bubble accumulated at the bottom of the crater, the release of which could lead to a phenomenon similar to the one known from Lake Nyos in Cameroon.

### Why is it essential to monitor submarine volcanoes, and what challenges are posed by their monitoring?

Submarine volcanoes are exceptionally dangerous, primarily due to the threat of tsunamis. While on land, various physical and chemical measurements are used, monitoring underwater volcanoes is much more challenging. Methods based on electromagnetic radiation, such as satellite radar interferometry used elsewhere for highly precise monitoring of vertical ground movements, are practically impossible. All other instruments need to be installed underwater during costly marine expeditions. Fortunately, Kolumbo now has a subsea volcanic monitoring observatory called SANTORY, and its development can be followed at https://santory.gr/.

### What is full-waveform inversion (FWI) seismic imaging, and how is it used in the study of the Kolumbo submarine volcano?

The FWI method can be thought of as a combination of two diagnostic medical techniques - ultrasound (USG) and computed tomography (CT). As a result, we can not only precisely determine the contours of the studied object, as in USG but also, by looking through it from different angles, we can determine its physical properties.

Unfortunately, we cannot place a volcano in a tomography machine and scan it from every possible angle. Therefore, geophysicists had to develop much more sophisticated mathematical tools than those used in medicine, to provide reliable and useful results despite less than perfect data. Instead of X-rays and ultrasounds, we use seismic waves generated by natural earthquakes or minor tremors generated by research equipment.

### How was the presence of a magma chamber in the Greek volcano detected?

The above-mentioned imaging method allowed us to obtain a three-dimensional distribution of elastic properties, specifically the seismic wave propagation velocities, inside the volcano. These properties are closely related to the degree of rock melting. The more molten the rock, the slower seismic waves travel through it. A similar observation led to the discovery of Earth's liquid outer core.

The connection between the rock's state and the wave's speed can be understood using a Mexican wave analogy seen in football stadiums. If spectators were tightly packed in a row, holding hands, a jump of the first person would immediately lift the next, and the wave would propagate much faster than if they were sitting far apart. Similarly, in solid rocks, molecules are densely packed in a crystalline lattice and transmit vibrations much faster than in a liquid, even one as viscous as magma.

Under Kolumbo, we found an area with dramatically reduced seismic wave velocities. Interestingly, this anomaly almost completely eluded the standard imaging method used for the same data, which has been the primary geophysical tool for studying volcanoes worldwide.

The velocity turned out to be so low that it couldn't be explained solely by high temperature; there had to be rock melting. Furthermore, the degree of melting is likely high enough to refer to it as magma, rather than a so-called crystal mush, where very small (a few % of the rock volume) amounts of melt are distributed in microscopic spaces between crystalline grains. Contrary to textbook images depicting a large magma chamber beneath every active volcano, the current paradigm places mush as the prevailing form of "existence" of melt inside the Earth, and magma chambers are considered transient, and therefore challenging to detect with geophysical methods. If a triggering factor, such as an injection of hot basaltic magma from greater depths, doesn't arrive in time, the magma chamber will cool down and almost completely crystallize, creating a mush.

### How do geophysicists estimate the size/growth of a volcano's magma chamber (using the example of Kolumbo)?

Using the theory of homogenization, we can calculate the proportion of melt to solid rock from the seismic velocity of partially molten rock. Having a three-dimensional image of the seismic wave velocity, we can estimate how much melt is present inside the volcano in total. We can also determine how much melt resides as magma and how much as crystal mush. However, this calculation is burdened with greater uncertainty due to the fundamental ambiguity resulting from potentially different geometries of rock pores in which the melt accumulates.

Estimating the growth rate, in our case, is based on the assumption that all the melt was delivered/produced since the previous eruption. In other words, the previous eruption completely emptied the magma chamber. Of course, this is an oversimplification, and the result is subject to the greatest uncertainty among those mentioned.

### In what time frame could a theoretically awakening of the Kolumbo volcano occur?

Such estimates are usually made based on the average frequency of past eruptions. In Kolumbo's case, we know for certain that there have been at least six eruptions in the last million years, giving an average eruption frequency slightly greater than 1 every 200,000 years. Considering that the last eruption was 400 years ago, we might think we're safe. Unfortunately, due to the difficult accessibility for direct research, our knowledge of previous eruptions is quite general, and continuous hydrothermal and seismic activity related to the imaged magma chamber suggests that the decision to monitor was justified, as mentioned earlier.

Currently, an expedition of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) is underway, with participants, including one of the co-authors of our article, conducting deep-sea drilling of sediment cores in the immediate vicinity of Kolumbo. The analysis of these drilling cores will provide us with a much better understanding of the history of previous eruptions and improve our very imperfect predictions.
