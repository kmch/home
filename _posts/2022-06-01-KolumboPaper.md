In the [G3 paper](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022GC010475) we used a high-resolution technology based on inverting full seismic waveforms to image a small, high-melt-fraction magma chamber that was not detected with standard seismic tomography. The melt reservoir extends from âˆ¼2 to at least 4 km below sea level (b.s.l.) at Kolumbo - a submarine volcano near Santorini, Greece. The chamber coincides with the termination point of the recent earthquake swarms and may be a missing link between a deeper melt reservoir and the high-temperature hydrothermal system venting at the crater floor.

For a layman explanation of this research, see [my interview for the "Volcanoes of the world" blog]({% post_url 2024-09-26-wulkanyswiata %}).

For a bigger picture and a discussion of the wavefront-healing phenomenon, you may want to read a comprehensive review of seismic-imaging studies of volcanoes worldwide:
