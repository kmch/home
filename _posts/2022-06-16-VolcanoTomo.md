Seismic methods provide the highest-resolution constraints on the internal structure of volcanoes inaccessible to direct observations.

Our extensive review of the state of the art in seismic imaging of magmatic systems is now freely available [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/earth-science/articles/10.3389/feart.2022.970131/full) along with the open-source [repository](https://github.com/VolcanoTomo/Repository)! 

For a neat, semi-visual introduction to the topic, [volcanoroots](https://volcanoroots.org/volcano-tomography/) is the website to visit.
