I am an applied physicist and geologist with expertise in high‑resolution, elastic‑wave **imaging** applicable to a variety of academic, industrial, and medical problems. 
In 2022 I received a PhD in Earth Science from **Imperial College London**. 
Before, I obtained a BSc in physics, BSc in geology and MSc in geophysics from the College of Inter-Faculty Individual Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences at the **University of Warsaw**. 

I am particularly interested in Earth’s interior, wave mechanics, **inverse problems** and object‑oriented design. 
I firmly believe in **reproducible research** and open‑source software.
