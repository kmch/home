I"À<p>Hi! Iâ€™m Kajetan, a physicist trying to understand how our home planet
was formed and how it operates. Iâ€™d love to know how to protect this unique paradise for as long as possible.</p>

<p>I am an expert in highâ€‘resolution, <strong>3D wave imaging</strong> techniques applicable to a variety of academic, industrial, and medical problems. 
My scientific attention has so far been focused on Earthâ€™s interior, wave mechanics, <strong>inverse problems</strong> and objectâ€‘oriented design.  <br />
I firmly believe in <strong>reproducible research</strong> and openâ€‘source software.</p>

<p>In 2022 I received a <strong>PhD</strong> in Earth Science from <strong>Imperial College London</strong>, at the time the <strong>8th best university in the world</strong>.<br />
Before that, I obtained three different degrees (BSc in physics, BSc in geology and MSc in geophysics) from the College of Inter-Faculty Individual Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences at the University of Warsaw. It was a fantastic adventure!</p>

<p>With this website, I aim to attract young people to <strong>honest, curiosity-driven science</strong>. I hope to get across
the fascination for the complexity of the â€˜physicalâ€™ (natural) world that drew me to science in the first place.
Please drop me an <a href="mailto:k.chrapkiewicz17@imperial.ac.uk">email</a> if you are interested in 
<strong>collaboration, internship, advice, or just have a science-related question</strong>. I am always happy to try and help!</p>

<p>I am <strong>open for work</strong> on environmentally and socially sustainable projects.
